The graph used for this task was taken from the reference:

SANTOS, M.K.; DANILEVICZ, A.M.F.; TUBINO, R.M.C. Environmental service providers assessment: A multi-criteria model applied to industrial waste. Journal of Cleaner Production, v.159, p. 374-387, 2017.

#Analysis

1. The graphic is without x-axis label. Thus, it is not known the measure of this axis.
2. The y-axis label is incomplete. So, it is not possible to know all the aspects studied only through the graph.
3. The visualization of the different bars is good. It is possible to identify each bar even though the printout is in black and white.
